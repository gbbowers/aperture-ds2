## Description
Aperture uses a **4-based scale** for units of measure, unless an element is sized dynamically as part of the [Aperture Grid system](../../structure/content/grid). Even still, aside from the dynamic width of columns in the grid layout, all other units are measured in factors or fractions of the base unit 16, which is represented as 1rem in our CSS. Therefore, common sizes are used frequently in margins, padding, and other types of spacing.
