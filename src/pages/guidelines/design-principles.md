<h2 class="indexExplain">Bazaarvoice practices <em>Inclusive Design</em></h2>

We're creating the best products and services for our customers; Never assume it won't matter to the individual user.

### Speak the user's language
Keep it simple and avoid insider jargon, company-speak, and overtly technical terminology. Tie tasks, steps, and the actions to perform them to consistent terms.

### Reduce concepts to increase confidence
Avoid the monolithic interface. Just because we have all the data doesn't mean the task requires it to be shown. Several linear steps are easier than one complex interface. Fewer clicks does not mean easier.

### Build for time, flexibility, and shifting context
The user cannot guarantee their attention to a task. They will get distracted, need to get more information, coffee, or a second opinion. Their internet connection may be flaky. They have more meetings than you do. Ensure your workflows allow for picking up later and finishing when the user needs to.

### Include more people and situations
You are not the user, and the persona is only a generalization of desired outcomes. Edge cases marginalize users. If you can't get it for 100% of the target users, get 90% and follow up soon.

### Perfect is the enemy of Good
Don't beat yourself up because you can't reach perfection. You will always have a chance to iterate and improve the experience. Ship something good and save time to follow up soon.

### Decisions backed by research win
In a debate over direction, gut-feelings and loud opinions always lose to out research and analysis. Balance the flow of cold quantitative results with hot qualitative results. You get more from users than you do from metrics.
